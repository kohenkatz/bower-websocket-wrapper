# bower-websocket-wrapper

A super-simple wrapper to allow packages that depend on the [WebSocket NPM package](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node) to be used with Bower.

Supports only the `W3Websocket` component of that package.

Example for use (ES2015):

```
import {w3cwebsocket as W3CWebSocket} from 'websocket';
```
